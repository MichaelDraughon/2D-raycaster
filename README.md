# 2D-raycaster
Just a little for fun 2D raycasting engine, it can render lines, and has a few bugs that I will be working out

RayMarching 1.1.0.1 is currently the most efficient version of the engine.

All you need to do to run this simple demonstration is download the Processing compiler from https://processing.org/download/, and then just open up any of the related filed inside the compiler and run them (sorry I haven't made it an executable yet)
